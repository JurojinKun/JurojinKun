🌱 **Young shooter in the development world** 🌱

I am a 26 year old french engineer who started his career in the world of AI, image processing and computer vision. 👨‍🎓
I am currently and for 2 years and a half, a self-taught frontend developer in the vast world of mobile and web development. 📱
Why not learn the backend to become a full stack developer soon? 🧠

### Projects

🔭 For some time, I have been working on projects that are close to my heart and that come out of my head when I have free time:
- [Gemu](https://github.com/Gemu-Inc/Gemu_ui), v1 of a social network application for people interested in e-sport and video games developed in Flutter linked to a Firebase server 🔜 Why not have a version 2, case to follow...
- [My youkounkoun](https://github.com/JurojinKun/my_youkounkoun_front), an application made from scratch which is meant to be an application with already a lot of basics and features very useful when creating a new application. Why start from scratch every time? The front-end application is developed in Flutter and the back-end will be developed in Node.js with a MySQL database.

In the future I hope, many other projects straight out of my imagination! 🤔

💼 **Learning:** coding, communicating but also listening, calm and peace. Becoming the best version of myself.

❤️ **Passion (at night):** constant search for new features, optimizations and fixing different bugs on a project (what a relief 😅)

🎧 **Music:** Wherever I go and whatever I do, music will follow me everywhere to escape
